# SysModels

This is a Julia package for creating Systems Models.

It requires Julia 1.5+.

Clone this repository to your system and 'develop' it from the julia shell.  (Press ']' to enter the Pkg prompt)

```julia
(@v1.5) pkg> develop /path/to/SysModels
```


There are some small examples in the test/ directory, and some larger ones,
based on the code used in some of the papers below, in the examples/ folder.

Better documentation will be coming soon.

The code was written for modelling aspects of organizational security, and the
package currently reflects this.  Eventually, the goal is to move the
security-specific code into its own SecModels package, leaving the generic systems
modelling code here.

The code was written as part of the
[Productive Security](http://www.riscs.org.uk/?page_id=15) project, and was
used in several publications:
